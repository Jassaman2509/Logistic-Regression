# Logistic-Regression
Logistic regression, despite its name, is a classification model rather than regression model. Logistic regression is a simple and more efficient method for binary and linear classification problems. It is a classification model, which is very easy to realize and achieves very good performance with linearly separable classes. It is an extensively employed algorithm for classification in industry. The logistic regression model, like the Adaline and perceptron, is a statistical method for binary classification that can be generalized to multiclass classification. Scikit-learn has a highly optimized version of logistic regression implementation, which supports multiclass classification task.
he best way to think about logistic regression is that it is a linear regression but for classification problems. Logistic regression essentially uses a logistic function defined below to model a binary output variable. The primary difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that logistic regression's range is bounded between 0 and 1. In addition, as opposed to linear regression, logistic regression does not require a linear relationship between inputs and output variables. This is due to applying a nonlinear log transformation to the odds ratio
